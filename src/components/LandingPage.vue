        I am a qualified football tactical analyst working in football analysis for the past 3 and a half years. Learning my trade with FC Barcelona 
        and working with Spanish youth teams and 'B' sides,  I now work in the lower levels of English football providing football analysis to several different clubs.

                I will be posting new videos on YouTube as often as I can with the primary focus being tactical analysis in the lower leagues of English football. 
                The lower leagues are sadly not well represented in the media so I plan to bring focus to those leagues offering the type of analysis I over to the 
                clubs that I report for.

              Opposition and team analysis is increasingly more important in todays game. The ability to scrutinise opposition teams, providing strengths and
              weaknesses to the coaching staff can be the difference between winning and losing. I have been providing reports over the last 3 years for clubs 
              in the MLS, EFL2, EFL1, National League and National league north and south.

              Data has become more and more important in todays game. I have previously worked with event data from StatsBomb and Wyscout to provide 
              a deeper look into a teams data and more meaningful insight that can be used to gain a competitive advantage.
